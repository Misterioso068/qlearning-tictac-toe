# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

A **reinforcement learning (Q-learning) Tic-Tac-Toe agent** written in C.  
This program can train itself via self-play, store its learned intelligence, and play against a human with adjustable difficulty.

---

## Features

- **Self-play training:** The agent improves by playing games against itself.  
- **Human play mode:** Play against the trained agent.  
- **Adjustable difficulty:** Control randomness/exploration with `epsilon`.  
- **Persistent intelligence:** Learned strategies are saved/loaded from a file.

---

## Implementation

- **Q-Learning:** The agent maintains a Q-table of size `19683 × 9` (3^9 board states × 9 possible moves).  
- **Epsilon-greedy policy:** Chooses the best move most of the time, but occasionally explores random moves.  
- **Self-play training:** One Q-table is used for both “players,” so the agent learns optimal strategies over time.  
- **Board encoding:** Each board is encoded as a base-3 number to uniquely identify states.  

---

## Requirements

- GCC (or compatible C compiler)  
- Linux, macOS, or Windows environment  
- Make (optional, recommended for building)  

---

## Compilation

Build the program using the included `Makefile`:
```bash
make
```

This will compile the program and place the executable in the `build/` folder:
```bash
build/tictactoe
```

To clean build artifacts:
```bash
make clean
```

Usage
-----

The program is run from the terminal using **command-line arguments**.

### Required flags

-   `-M <mode>` -- Mode of operation:

    -   `play` -- Play against the agent.

    -   `train` -- Train the agent via self-play.

-   `-F <filename>` -- Path to the existing Q-table file or path you want the file made and stored.

### Optional flags

-   `-D <difficulty>` -- Set the AI difficulty when playing against it:

    -   `easy` (epsilon = 0.5)

    -   `medium` (epsilon = 0.3)

    -   `hard` (epsilon = 0.1)
    
    -   `impossible` (epsilon = 0.0)

    - Default value: `easy`

-   `-I <games>` — Number of self-play games used during training.

    - Only applies when `-M train` is used.

    - Default value: `100000`

### Examples
Train a an agent (default 100,000 games):
```bash
./build/tictactoe -M train -F agents/agent1.bin
```

Train an agent with a custom number of games:
```bash
./build/tictactoe -M train -F agents/agent1.bin -I 1000000
```

Play against the trained agent (hard difficulty):
```bash
./build/tictactoe -M play -F agents/agent1.bin -D hard
```

Play against the agent with perfect play:
```bash
./build/tictactoe -M play -F agents/agent1.bin -D impossible
```

**Note:** 
If the agent has not been trained for at least 100,000 games, the difficulty levels may not behave as expected. For example, the impossible difficulty may still make suboptimal moves if the agent has not fully learned optimal play.

How It Works
------------

### Training Mode

-   The agent plays itself repeatedly.

-   Q-values are updated using the formula: `Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α * (reward - Q(s,a))`

-   After enough iterations, the agent learns perfect play.

### Play Mode

-   Human plays as X; the agent plays as O.

-   The AI chooses moves using the learned Q-table and `epsilon` for exploration.
